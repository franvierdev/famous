Notable contributions came from influencers such as Melissa Navarro and Anahí Ríos, who significantly boosted the visibility and engagement of the campaign. {br} {br} Engagement was exceptionally high across the board, with our content achieving an average engagement rate of 4.62%. Engaging, high-quality posts drove significant increases in likes, comments, shares, and saves, and individual posts from influencers like Fer Jalil and Vale de la Cuesta generated millions of views, highlighting the campaign’s deep resonance with the target audience. {br} {br} Our initial goal was to achieve 2.5-3 million views per month.
